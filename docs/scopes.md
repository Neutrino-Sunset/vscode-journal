# Scopes

Scopes help you to manage notes within your different projects by declaring individual configurations. Scopes are specific tags such as "#clientA" or "#private". When creating a new note and using that tag in the input box, you tell the extension to use the scope's configuration (and not the global configuration of the journal). 

## Setting up a new scope
Let's stick to the example of the new scope "#clientA", which you plan to use to store all notes in a new project coming up with a Client.
