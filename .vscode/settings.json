/*
ðŸ‘‹ Hi! This file was autogenerated by tslint-to-eslint-config.
https://github.com/typescript-eslint/tslint-to-eslint-config

It represents the closest reasonable ESLint configuration to this
project's original TSLint configuration.

We recommend eventually switching this configuration to extend from
the recommended rulesets in typescript-eslint. 
https://github.com/typescript-eslint/tslint-to-eslint-config/blob/master/docs/FAQs.md

Happy linting! ðŸ’–
